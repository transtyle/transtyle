## 0.1.0-alpha.3

### Patch Changes

- 3d71e2f: Ship `CHANGELOG.md` in every published package.

  npm always includes `README` and `LICENSE` regardless of the `files` allowlist, but not the changelog — so the first three alphas published with no version history at all, on the one page a stranger reads to decide whether upgrading is safe. Changesets has been writing the file since `0.1.0-alpha.0`; only the allowlist was keeping it in the repo.

  `check:manifests` now requires it, so a package added later cannot quietly ship without one.

- af10209: Ship the MIT licence text in every published package.

  npm adds a `LICENSE` file to a tarball only when one sits in the package directory. Only the monorepo root had one, so the first three alphas published twelve packages that each declared `"license": "MIT"` without carrying the text those terms ask to be distributed with them.

  Each package now holds a copy, and `check:manifests` requires it to be byte-identical to the root one — twelve copies of a licence being exactly the sort of thing that drifts a copyright year with nobody noticing.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

- 16dc98d: Give every package a README, and point `homepage` at its documentation page.

  All twelve packages shipped `0.1.0-alpha.0` and `.1` with no README, so each rendered as a blank page on npmjs.com — the surface most people meet the project on, and the only one nobody working in the repo ever reopens. Each now says what it emits, how to use it, and that it is an experimental alpha, and links into the documentation site rather than at the monorepo root.

  `@transtyle/exporter-primeng`'s description also claimed it was "not yet registered in the CLI". It has been since C6; the sentence was published to npm twice after it stopped being true.

  `check:manifests` grew two checks for the class: a package must have a README that is more than a stub, and a `homepage` naming a docs page must name one that exists — a 404 baked into published metadata cannot be fixed without another release.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- @transtyle/ir@0.1.0-alpha.1

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- First public alpha.

  Transtyle compiles a framework-agnostic description of a design system — DTCG tokens plus semantics and modes — into native theme artifacts for eight targets: Bootstrap, shadcn/ui, daisyUI, Apache ECharts, Storybook, Radix Colors/Themes, PrimeNG, and plain CSS variables. Unauthored values are filled by deterministic, inspectable derivation rules rather than hidden defaults, every generated value carries provenance you can query with `transtyle explain`, and every build emits a coverage report saying what mapped natively, what was derived, what was approximated, and what the target cannot express.

  All three token tiers — raw/option, semantic and component — are mapped on the two component-heavy targets, Bootstrap and PrimeNG, each measured against a checked-in inventory of the target's real theming surface so gaps are reported rather than quietly skipped.

  Import is DTCG only in this release. Tailwind, Figma and CSS-custom-property importers are post-alpha.

  **This is an experimental alpha.** Breaking changes ship without a deprecation cycle: the token vocabulary, the generated output, the config format and the CLI surface can each change between alpha releases, and none of it carries a stability or support promise. Pin an exact version, and treat generated files as disposable output you regenerate rather than hand-edit. The reasoning is recorded in ADR-0010; the release process is documented in RELEASING.md.
